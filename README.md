# Microfinance Application - Planning and Requirement Analysis

## Overview
This document outlines the planning and requirement analysis phase for the development of a microfinance application. This phase is critical for setting the foundation, ensuring that business and technical needs are clearly defined, and aligning all stakeholders on the goals and objectives of the application.

## Objectives
The main objectives for the Planning and Requirement Analysis phase are as follows:
1. **Define Core Functionality and Scope:**
   - Identify primary features and integrations needed for the application.
   - Clarify the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) to ensure timely delivery.
2. **Identify Stakeholders and Roles:**
   - Establish who will be involved and their responsibilities throughout the project.
3. **Gather Requirements for User Roles, Dashboards, and Features:**
   - Understand the unique requirements for different users (customers, admins, employees).
4. **Document Technical and Non-Technical Specifications:**
   - Prepare detailed documentation to guide the development process.
5. **Prepare for Design and Development Phases:**
   - Establish a clear roadmap for the design and implementation phases.
